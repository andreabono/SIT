        <p>Seismic events have always been a subject of significant interest and concern due to their potential for causing widespread damage and loss of life. The accurate analysis of waveforms is crucial to understand the characteristics of earthquakes and other related phenomena. Even today, some institutions involved in local/regional seismic monitoring rely on expensive commercial software for data analysis. In other instances, they use custom-developed, platform dependent and more or less standardized tools that often employ proprietary formats for data representation and storage. Even those engaged in offline analysis of seismograms often resort to small, custom-built programs or turn to the well-known Seismic Analysis Code (SAC, Goldstein et Al. 2003), which, however, is quite far from satisfactory in terms of user interface and usability.
        The Seismic Intelligence Tool incorporates into its original concept the ideas expressed in Bono and Badiali (2004) and aims to become a more modern and equally powerful data analysis software, with the potential to profitably complement the currently used software over time, through collaboration with the scientific community.
        As a natural derivation from Caravelâ€™s PickFX software (Bono et Al., 2021) SIT incorporates the most common functions for the interpretation of a seismic signal, in addition to the capability to edit it with Finite and Infinite Impulse Response filters  and some others. After performing phase picking, the operator can choose whether to store them locally in a QuakeML (Schorlemmer et Al., 2004) file or in a relational database.
